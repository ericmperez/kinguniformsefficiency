2. Client Aggregation: Individual client behavior analysis  
3. Time Series Trend: Recent trend analysis with linear regression

// Weighted ensemble averaging based on model confidence
totalPredictedWeight = Σ(model.weight × model.confidence) / Σ(model.confidence)
```

### **Enhanced Confidence Calculation**
```typescript
enhancedConfidence = (
  dataPointsFactor × 0.3 +      // More historical data
  recentDataFactor × 0.3 +      // Recent activity weight  
  variabilityFactor × 0.3 +     // Pattern consistency
  outlierPenalty × 0.1          // Unusual data impact
) × enhancedLikelihood
```

### **Outlier Detection & Handling**
```typescript
// IQR-based outlier detection
const q1 = weights[Math.floor(weights.length * 0.25)];
const q3 = weights[Math.floor(weights.length * 0.75)];
const iqr = q3 - q1;
const outlierBounds = [q1 - 1.5 * iqr, q3 + 1.5 * iqr];

// Weighted statistics: 70% normal data, 30% outlier data
avgWeight = (normalWeight × 0.7) + (outlierWeight × 0.3)
```
