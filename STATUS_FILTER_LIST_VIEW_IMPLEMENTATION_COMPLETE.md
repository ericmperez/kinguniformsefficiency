# Status Filter Cards and List View Implementation - Complete

## üéâ Implementation Summary

The status filter cards and list view functionality has been successfully implemented in the Active Invoices page. All requested features are now live and functional.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. Status Filter Cards
- **Location**: Horizontal row above the invoice display, aligned to the left
- **Filters Available**:
  - `All` - Shows all active invoices (excludes 'done' status)
  - `In Progress` - Shows unverified invoices that are not completed or done
  - `Completed` - Shows completed invoices that are not yet verified
  - `Approved` - Shows verified invoices (not done)
  - `Partial` - Shows partially verified invoices
  - `Shipped` - Shows invoices with 'done' status

### 2. View Toggle (Cards/List)
- **Location**: Right side of the same row as filter cards
- **Options**:
  - `Cards` - Original card-based layout (default)
  - `List` - New table-based layout with feature parity

### 3. List View Features
- **Responsive Table**: Bootstrap table with hover effects
- **Columns**:
  - Client (with avatar)
  - Invoice #
  - Date
  - Carts count
  - Total items
  - Status
  - Actions
- **Status-based Row Colors**:
  - Green: Verified/Approved invoices
  - Yellow: Client pickup or partially verified
  - Blue: Ready invoices
  - Default: In progress invoices
- **Click Functionality**: Clicking any row opens the invoice details modal
- **Full Feature Parity**: All functionality from cards view is preserved

## üé® UI/UX Details

### Layout
```
[Filter Cards: All | In Progress | Completed | Approved | Partial | Shipped]     [Cards | List]
```

### Styling
- **Filter Cards**: Small buttons with Bootstrap icons and hover effects
- **Active State**: Primary blue color for selected filter/view
- **Responsive**: Stacks vertically on smaller screens
- **Icons**: Bootstrap Icons for visual clarity

## üîß Technical Implementation

### State Management
- `statusFilter`: Controls which status filter is active
- `viewMode`: Controls whether cards or list view is displayed
- `filteredInvoices`: Computed property that filters invoices based on selected status

### Filter Logic
```typescript
const filteredInvoices = useMemo(() => {
  if (statusFilter === 'all') return sortedInvoices.filter(inv => inv.status !== 'done');
  if (statusFilter === 'in_progress') return sortedInvoices.filter(inv => !inv.verified && inv.status !== 'done' && inv.status !== 'completed');
  if (statusFilter === 'completed') return sortedInvoices.filter(inv => inv.status === 'completed' && !inv.verified);
  if (statusFilter === 'approved') return sortedInvoices.filter(inv => inv.verified && inv.status !== 'done');
  if (statusFilter === 'partial') return sortedInvoices.filter(inv => inv.partiallyVerified && !inv.verified && inv.status !== 'done');
  if (statusFilter === 'shipped') return sortedInvoices.filter(inv => inv.status === 'done');
  return sortedInvoices.filter(inv => inv.status !== 'done');
}, [sortedInvoices, statusFilter]);
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Access the Application**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Log in if required
   - Go to the Active Invoices/Laundry Tickets page

2. **Test Status Filter Cards**
   - Verify all 6 filter buttons are visible: All, In Progress, Completed, Approved, Partial, Shipped
   - Click each filter button and verify:
     - Button becomes highlighted (blue background)
     - Invoice list updates to show only relevant invoices
     - Count of displayed invoices changes appropriately

3. **Test View Toggle**
   - Click "List" button and verify:
     - Table view appears with all invoice data
     - Table has proper column headers
     - Row colors match invoice status
     - Clicking rows opens invoice details modal
   - Click "Cards" button and verify:
     - Returns to original card layout
     - All card functionality works as before

4. **Test Combined Functionality**
   - Switch between different status filters while in list view
   - Verify filtering works correctly in both views
   - Test responsiveness on different screen sizes

### Expected Behavior

- **Default State**: "All" filter active, "Cards" view active
- **Filter Persistence**: Selected filter remains active when switching views
- **Responsive Design**: UI adapts properly to mobile/tablet screens
- **Performance**: Filtering and view switching should be instant

## üöÄ Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ **Build**: Compiles successfully without errors
- ‚úÖ **Development Server**: Running on port 5173
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript**: All type definitions correct
