# Deployment Configuration: Do Not Change `vercel.json`

**Important:**

- The `vercel.json` file is critical for correct deployment of this app to Vercel.
- Do not change the `routes` section or any other part of this file unless you fully understand the deployment requirements for static assets and SPA routing.
- Incorrect changes may break production deployments (e.g., cause blank pages or asset loading errors).
- If you need to update deployment settings, please consult the project maintainer or review the deployment documentation first.
