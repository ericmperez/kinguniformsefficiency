{isVerified ? (
  `🟢 ${group.clientName}` // Verified clients
) : isVerifying ? (
  `🔍 ${group.clientName}` // Currently verifying
) : idx === 0 ? (
  group.clientName // First client always visible
) : (
  `Client #${idx + 1}` // Other clients numbered
)}
```

### ✅ **Contextual Input Fields**
```typescript
// Client-specific placeholders and labels
placeholder={`Cart ID for ${group.clientName}`}
label="Enter Cart ID for [Client Name]:"
```

### ✅ **Visual Styling**
```css
fontSize: "20px"
fontWeight: "800" 
color: "#0d47a1"
textShadow: "0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"
```
