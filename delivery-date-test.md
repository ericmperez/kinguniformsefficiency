## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. InvoiceForm.tsx (Invoice Creation)
- ✅ Added `deliveryDate` state variable
- ✅ Added delivery date input field in the form
- ✅ Updated `handleConfirm` to include delivery date in new invoices
- ✅ Set minimum date to today (prevents past dates)

### 2. InvoiceDetailsModal.tsx (Invoice Editing)
- ✅ Added delivery date editing state variables
- ✅ Added `formatDateForInput` helper function to handle date format conversion

### 3. ActiveInvoices.tsx (Backend Handler)
- ✅ Added `__delivery_date__` special handler in `onAddCart` function
- ✅ Properly updates invoice with delivery date using `onUpdateInvoice`

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Invoice Creation**: Users can now set a delivery date when creating new invoices
2. **Invoice Editing**: Users can edit the delivery date of existing invoices through the details modal
3. **Date Format Handling**: Proper conversion between display format and input format
4. **Validation**: Prevents setting delivery dates in the past
5. **Integration**: Delivery dates set during creation/editing will appear in the shipping dashboard

## Expected Behavior

- When creating a new invoice, users can optionally set a delivery date
- When editing an existing invoice, users can click the edit button next to "Delivery Date" 
- The date input properly handles the YYYY-MM-DD format required by HTML date inputs
- The delivery date is saved to Firestore and will be available for shipping dashboard filtering
- Empty delivery dates are handled gracefully (show as "Not set")

## Testing Steps

1. Create a new invoice and set a delivery date (e.g., 2025-07-24)
2. Verify the delivery date is saved correctly
3. Edit an existing invoice and change the delivery date
4. Verify the changes are persisted
5. Check that invoices with delivery dates appear in the shipping dashboard on the correct date

## Date Format Issue Resolution

The original issue where "07/24/2025" was defaulting to today's date has been resolved by:
- Using proper YYYY-MM-DD format for HTML date inputs
- Adding `formatDateForInput` helper function to convert dates correctly
- Ensuring the date value is properly synchronized between state and input field
