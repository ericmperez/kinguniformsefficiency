## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Database Updates
```typescript
const emailStatusUpdate = {
  emailStatus: {
    ...invoice.emailStatus,
    manualEmailSent: true,
    manualEmailSentAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    lastEmailError: undefined,
  },
};
```

### Activity Logging
```typescript
await logActivity({
  type: "Invoice",
  message: `Invoice #${invoice.invoiceNumber || invoice.id} manually marked as sent for ${client.name} (${client.email})`,
});
```

### Validation Logic
- **Email Configuration**: Client must have email address configured
- **Email Settings**: Client must have email settings enabled
- **Status Check**: Only shows for invoices that haven't been marked as sent
