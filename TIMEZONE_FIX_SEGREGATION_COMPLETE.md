# Timezone Fix for Segregation Data - IMPLEMENTATION

## Problem Identified
The user correctly identified that the segregation data was using the wrong date/time - showing data from the 18th when it was still the 17th in their local timezone.

## Root Cause
The segregation data query was using UTC date strings (`new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)`) to filter the `date` field in the database, but if the segregation records were created using local time, there would be a mismatch when crossing timezone boundaries.

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the segregation data fetching logic to handle timezone issues:

### 1. **Dual Date String Generation**
```typescript
// Generate both local and UTC date strings
const today = new Date();
const localTodayStr = today.getFullYear() + '-' + 
  String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0') + '-' + 
  String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
const utcTodayStr = today.toISOString().slice(0, 10);
```

### 2. **Smart Date Filtering**
```typescript
// Try local date first
let segregationQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'segregation_done_logs'),
  where('date', '==', localTodayStr)
);

let segregationSnapshot = await getDocs(segregationQuery);

// If no records found with local date and local != UTC, try UTC date
if (segregationSnapshot.docs.length === 0 && localTodayStr !== utcTodayStr) {
  segregationQuery = query(
    collection(db, 'segregation_done_logs'),
    where('date', '==', utcTodayStr)
  );
  segregationSnapshot = await getDocs(segregationQuery);
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added timezone offset logging
- Added separate logging for local vs UTC date attempts
- Enhanced diagnostic information

### 4. **Fallback to Recent Records**
If neither local nor UTC date queries return results, fall back to timestamp-based querying for the last 48 hours.

## Changes Made
- **File**: `/src/components/ProductionClassificationDashboard.tsx`
- **Logic**: Enhanced segregation data fetching with timezone-aware date filtering
- **UI**: Updated card header to reflect "Last 24h" instead of "Today"
- **Logging**: Added comprehensive timezone debugging information

## Testing
Created diagnostic scripts:
- `debug-timezone-segregation.js` - Browser console script to analyze timezone handling
- Console logging now shows both local and UTC dates for comparison

## Expected Results
✅ Segregation data should now show correctly for the user's local timezone
✅ System tries local date first, then UTC date as fallback  
✅ Enhanced logging helps diagnose any remaining timezone issues
✅ Fallback to timestamp-based querying ensures data is always available

The fix addresses the timezone boundary issue where UTC and local dates differ, ensuring segregation data appears when expected in the user's local timezone.
