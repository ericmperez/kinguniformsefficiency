/**
 * Test Weight Merging in Invoice Merge
 * 
 * This script tests the newly implemented weight combining feature when merging invoices.
 * 
 * Test Scenarios:
 * 1. Both invoices have weight - should combine
 * 2. Only source has weight - should use source weight
 * 3. Only target has weight - should keep target weight
 * 4. Neither has weight - should not add weight field
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * 1. Open the application at http://localhost:5175
 * 2. Navigate to ActiveInvoices page
 * 3. Create two invoices with weight values
 * 4. Open browser developer tools (F12)
 * 5. Paste this script into the console and press Enter
 * 6. Run: testWeightMerging()
