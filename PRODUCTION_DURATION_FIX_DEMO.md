🏁 END-OF-SHIFT DETECTION FIX DEMO
================================

✅ ISSUE FIXED:
   Problem: Dashboard showed "14.3h elapsed" (current time - start time)
   Solution: Now shows "6.2h" (last item time - start time)

📊 WHAT CHANGED:

1. CORRECTED CALCULATION:
   ❌ Before: productionDuration = currentTime - startTime  
   ✅ After:  productionDuration = lastItemTime - startTime

2. FIXED FIRST ENTRY TRACKING:
   ❌ Before: Used wrong property (g.recentActivity.lastEntry)
   ✅ After:  Uses correct property (g.firstEntry)

3. ENHANCED DASHBOARD DISPLAY:
   ✅ Added "Production Duration" card showing actual work span
   ✅ Shows time range: "8:00 AM - 2:10 PM" 
   ✅ Displays correct duration: "6.2h" (not elapsed time)

🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:
   - Production Duration: Shows actual work time (start to last item)
   - Last Item Processed: Shows when production actually ended
   - Time Since Last Item: Shows idle time since production ended

📱 VIEW THE FIX:
   Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see:
   - Daily Employee Dashboard 
   - Production Classification Dashboard
   
   Both now show the corrected end-of-shift detection!

🔧 FILES MODIFIED:
   ✅ ShiftEndDetectionService.ts - Fixed first entry tracking
   ✅ EndOfShiftDashboard.tsx - Added production duration display

🚀 The system now accurately shows production spans instead of
   elapsed time, giving you the real production duration!
