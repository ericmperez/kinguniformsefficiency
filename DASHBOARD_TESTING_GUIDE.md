# Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard - Testing Guide

## 🔐 Access Control
**Only users 1991, 1995, and 1167 can access the Real-Time Activity Dashboard.**

## Expected Behavior (This is NORMAL!)

### For a Fresh Implementation:
- ✅ **No user sessions** - Normal for new feature
- ✅ **No daily statistics** - Normal until users complete login/logout cycles  
- ✅ **Only old activity logs** - Expected from previous system usage

## How the Dashboard Works:

### 1. Live Activity Tab
- Shows activities from last 2 hours
- Shows currently online users (if any)
- Updates in real-time

### 2. Daily Statistics Tab  
- Shows login time, interactions, sessions per user per day
- Only populates AFTER users log out (when session ends)
- Can select different dates to view historical data

## Testing Steps:

### Step 1: Login Test
1. Go to your app: http://localhost:5181
2. Login with authorized user ID (1991, 1995, or 1167)
3. Check console for session creation logs
4. Go to Live Monitor dashboard
5. You should see yourself as "online user"

### Step 2: Activity Test
1. While logged in, click around the app
2. The dashboard should show your activities in real-time
3. Your "interaction count" should increase

### Step 3: Daily Stats Test  
1. Log out completely
2. This triggers session end and creates daily stats
3. Go back to dashboard → Daily Statistics tab
4. Select today's date
5. You should see your session data

## What You Should See Right Now:
- 🔴 "No users currently active" (normal)
- 📊 "No statistics available for this date" (normal)
- ⚡ Recent activities from other users (normal)

## This is a SUCCESS! 🎉
The dashboard is working correctly - it just needs actual user sessions to display data.
