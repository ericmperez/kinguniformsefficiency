# Signature PDF Email System - Implementation Complete ✅

## 📧 System Overview

The signature PDF email system is now fully implemented and operational. When a client's laundry is delivered and a signature is captured, the system can automatically:

1. **Generate a PDF** of the laundry ticket/invoice
2. **Send an email** to the client with the PDF attached
3. **Log the activity** for audit purposes

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Signature Capture Flow
```
User clicks "Mark as Picked Up" → SignatureModal opens → User signs → System saves signature → Email sent automatically
```

### 2. Email Configuration
- **Client Configuration**: Settings → 🖨️ Printing → Configure (for specific client)
- **Auto-send Options**: Enable "Auto-send on signature"
- **Email Templates**: Customize signature-specific email content

### 3. PDF Generation
- Uses `generateSimpleLaundryTicketPDF()` for reliable PDF creation
- Includes client info, invoice details, items processed, and totals
- Fallback to standard PDF service if needed

## ⚙️ Configuration Requirements

### For Signature Emails to Work:
1. **Client must have email address** configured
2. **Email settings enabled**: `printConfig.emailSettings.enabled = true`
3. **Auto-send on signature**: `printConfig.emailSettings.autoSendOnSignature = true`
4. **Backend server** running on port 5173

### Email Settings Location:
- Navigate to **Settings** → **🖨️ Printing**
- Find the client in the list
- Click **"Configure"** button
- Enable **"Email functionality"**
- Check **"Auto-send on signature"**
- Save configuration

## 📄 Technical Implementation

### Key Components:
- **SignatureModal.tsx**: Handles signature capture and triggers email
- **SignatureEmailService.ts**: Manages email sending logic
- **simplePdfService.ts**: Generates PDF attachments
- **emailService.ts**: Email sending with PDF support
- **PrintingSettings.tsx**: Configuration interface

### API Endpoints:
- **POST /api/send-test-email**: Sends emails with optional PDF attachments
- **POST /api/send-invoice**: Sends emails with PDF attachments (legacy)

### Email Flow:
```typescript
SignatureModal.saveSignature()
  ↓
sendSignatureEmailIfEnabled()
  ↓
SignatureEmailService.sendSignatureEmail()
  ↓
generateSimpleLaundryTicketPDF()
  ↓
sendSignatureEmail() (with PDF)
  ↓
Backend /api/send-test-email
  ↓
Email sent with PDF attachment
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Configure a client**:
   - Go to Settings → 🖨️ Printing
   - Find a client and click "Configure"
   - Enable email functionality
   - Check "Auto-send on signature"
   - Save configuration

2. **Test signature capture**:
   - Open an invoice/laundry ticket
   - Click "Mark as Picked Up" (or similar button)
   - Complete signature in modal
   - Save signature

3. **Verify email sent**:
   - Check browser console for success logs
   - Check email inbox for PDF attachment
   - Verify PDF contains correct invoice data

### Test Scripts Available:
- `test-signature-email-pdf.js` - Basic functionality test
- `test-complete-signature-flow.js` - Complete flow verification

### Direct API Testing:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/send-test-email \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "to": "test@kinguniforms.net",
    "subject": "Signature Confirmation",
    "body": "Your delivery has been confirmed.",
    "pdfBase64": "VGVzdCBQREY="
  }'
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Email not sent**:
   - Check client email configuration
   - Verify `autoSendOnSignature` is enabled
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure backend server is running

2. **PDF generation fails**:
   - Check browser console for PDF errors
   - Verify html2canvas and jsPDF libraries are loaded
   - System will send text-only email as fallback

3. **Backend connection issues**:
   - Verify API_BASE_URL points to http://localhost:5173
   - Check if backend server is running on port 5173
   - Test API endpoints directly with curl

### Debug Information:
- **Browser Console**: Look for logs starting with "📧", "📄", "✅", "❌"
- **Network Tab**: Check API calls to /api/send-test-email
- **Activity Logs**: Check Firebase for email activity entries
