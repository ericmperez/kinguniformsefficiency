# Consistent Professional Styling - All Production Logs ✅

## What Was Accomplished

All production logs (Segregation, Mangle, and Doblado) now use the **same professional styling** for a cohesive, uniform appearance throughout the Production Classification Dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Unified Table Headers**
**Before**: Different colored headers for each table type
- Segregation: `table-info` (professional blue)
- Mangle: `table-success` (green) 
- Doblado: `table-warning` (yellow)

**After**: All tables now use `table-info` (professional blue)
```typescript
<thead className="table-info">
```

### 2. **Standardized Time Column Styling** 
**Before**: Different badge colors for time displays
- Segregation: `badge bg-info` (blue)
- Mangle: `badge bg-success` (green)
- Doblado: `badge bg-warning text-dark` (yellow)

**After**: All tables now use `badge bg-info` (professional blue)
```typescript
<span className="badge bg-info">
  {formatTime(entry.addedAt)}
</span>
```

### 3. **Unified Quantity Column Styling**
**Before**: Different badge styling for quantities
- Segregation: `badge bg-success fs-6` (green, larger font)
- Mangle: `badge bg-primary` (blue, standard font)
- Doblado: `badge bg-primary` (blue, standard font)

**After**: All tables now use `badge bg-success fs-6` (green, larger font)
```typescript
<td className="text-center">
  <span className="badge bg-success fs-6">
    {entry.quantity.toLocaleString()}
  </span>
</td>
```

### 4. **Consistent Column Alignment**
Added `text-center` class to quantity column headers for better alignment across all tables.

## Professional Styling Features

All production log tables now share these professional features:

### **Visual Consistency**
- ✅ **Professional Blue Headers**: All tables use `table-info` for a clean, corporate look
- ✅ **Uniform Time Badges**: Blue `badge bg-info` for time consistency
- ✅ **Standardized Quantities**: Green `badge bg-success fs-6` for better visibility
- ✅ **Edge-to-edge Layout**: `card-body p-0` for clean table presentation
- ✅ **Interactive Styling**: `table-striped table-hover` for professional UX

### **Table Structure**
All tables maintain the same column structure where applicable:
- **Time**: Professional blue badge with formatted timestamp
- **Client Name**: Bold formatting for easy identification  
- **Weight/Product/Quantity**: Consistent green badge styling
- **Additional Info**: Consistent muted text styling
- **Status/User Info**: Professional badge styling

### **Segregation Table Unique Features**
The segregation table retains its unique "Segregated By" column while matching the overall styling:
```
Time | Client Name | Weight (lbs) | Segregated By | Status
```

### **Mangle/Doblado Table Structure**  
```
Time | Client Name | Product | Quantity | Added By | Invoice
```
