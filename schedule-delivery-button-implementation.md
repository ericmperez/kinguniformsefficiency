# Schedule Delivery Button Implementation - Complete

## Summary of Changes Made

### âœ… **Updated ActiveInvoices.tsx**
- Modified the Schedule Delivery button to only appear when an invoice is approved (verified or partially verified)
- The button was previously visible for all invoices but is now conditional

## Key Changes

### **Before:**
- Schedule Delivery button was always visible on all invoices
- Button allowed scheduling delivery dates even for unapproved invoices

### **After:**
- Schedule Delivery button only appears when `invoice.verified` or `invoice.partiallyVerified` is true
- Button behavior matches the special service delivery pattern
- Maintains existing functionality but with proper approval gate

## Code Changes

**File**: `/src/components/ActiveInvoices.tsx`

```tsx
// OLD CODE:
{/* Schedule Delivery button - Step 0 */}
<button
  className="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary"
  // ... button properties
>
  {/* button content */}
</button>

// NEW CODE:
{/* Schedule Delivery button - Step 0 - Only show when invoice is approved */}
{(invoice.verified || invoice.partiallyVerified) && (
  <button
    className="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary"
    // ... button properties
  >
    {/* button content */}
  </button>
)}
```

## User Experience

### **Workflow Now:**
1. **Create Invoice** â†’ Invoice is in "Active" state
2. **Complete Invoice** â†’ Invoice shows "Completed" status with yellow badge
3. **Approve Invoice** â†’ Invoice shows "Approved" status with green badge
4. **ðŸŽ¯ Schedule Delivery Button Appears** â†’ User can now set delivery date and truck
5. **Schedule Delivery** â†’ Invoice shows delivery badge with date and truck info
6. **Ship Invoice** â†’ Invoice is marked as shipped

### **Visual Indicators:**
- **Special Service Badge**: Red badge appears when special service is requested
- **Delivery Schedule Badge**: Blue badge appears when delivery is scheduled (shows date and truck)
- **Schedule Button**: Calendar icon button only appears after approval

## Benefits

1. **Proper Workflow Enforcement**: Ensures deliveries are only scheduled for approved invoices
2. **Consistency**: Matches the pattern used by special service delivery features  
3. **User Clarity**: Clear visual progression through invoice lifecycle
4. **Business Logic**: Prevents scheduling of unapproved work

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- âœ… Build process completed successfully
- âœ… TypeScript compilation passed
- âœ… No syntax or logical errors
- âœ… Conditional rendering works as expected

## Integration

This change integrates seamlessly with existing features:
- Delivery date scheduling modal (unchanged)
- Shipping dashboard filtering (unchanged)
- Invoice badge display (unchanged)
- Special service delivery (follows same pattern)

The Schedule Delivery button now appears exactly like the Special Service delivery feature - only when the invoice has been properly approved, providing a clean and logical workflow for users.
