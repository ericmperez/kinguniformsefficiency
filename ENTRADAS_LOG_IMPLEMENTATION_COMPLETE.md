  - Number of pickup entries today
  - Total weight processed today

### 2. **Pickup Entries Data Table**

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### State Management
```typescript
const [pickupEntriesToday, setPickupEntriesToday] = useState<Array<{
  id: string;
  clientId: string;
  clientName: string;
  driverId: string;
  driverName: string;
  groupId: string;
  weight: number;
  timestamp: string;
}>>([]);
const [totalPickupWeight, setTotalPickupWeight] = useState(0);
const [pickupEntriesLoading, setPickupEntriesLoading] = useState(true);
```

### Data Fetching
```typescript
// Query pickup_entries for today
const pickupEntriesQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'pickup_entries'),
  where('timestamp', '>=', Timestamp.fromDate(today)),
  where('timestamp', '<', Timestamp.fromDate(tomorrow))
);

// Process all entries with proper timestamp handling
// Sort by timestamp (most recent first)
// Calculate total weight
```

### Table Structure
```tsx
<table className="table table-striped table-hover mb-0">
  <thead className="table-info">
    <tr>
      <th>Time</th>
      <th>Client Name</th>
      <th>Driver Name</th>
      <th className="text-center">Weight (lbs)</th>
      <th className="text-center">Status</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {/* Professional badge styling for each column */}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

## 📊 DATA FLOW

```
Pickup Process → pickup_entries → Production Dashboard
     ↓               ↓                    ↓
1. Driver makes    2. Entry created    3. Dashboard displays:
   pickup            with weight data    - Total entries/weight
2. Weight recorded 3. Includes client   - Detailed log table
3. Entry logged      and driver info    - Processing times
```
