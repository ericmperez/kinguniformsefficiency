# Testing Checklist: Mananti PDF Options & Timestamp Removal

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes
1. **PDF Options Logic Fix**: Modified `SignedDeliveryTicket.tsx` to make `contentDisplay` properly override `invoicePrintSettings.showProductSummary`
2. **Timestamp Removal**: Removed all "Generated on" timestamps from delivery tickets
3. **Test Script**: Fixed syntax error and added validation logic

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Test Mananti PDF Options Fix

#### Prerequisites:
- [ ] App is running at `http://localhost:5174`
- [ ] Mananti Medical Center exists in the clients database
- [ ] Mananti has PDF options configured with `contentDisplay: 'detailed'`

#### Testing Process:
1. **Open the app** at `http://localhost:5174`
2. **Navigate** to "Delivered Invoices" page
3. **Open browser console** (F12)
4. **Paste the test script** from `/test-mananti-pdf-options.js`
5. **Run the test**: `testManantiPDFOptions()`

#### Expected Results:
- [ ] Script finds Mananti Medical Center
- [ ] Shows `contentDisplay: 'detailed'` 
- [ ] Shows `Show Product Summary: NO` (this was the problem)
- [ ] **FIXED LOGIC** section shows `Show Detailed Items (FIXED): true`
- [ ] Reports "SUCCESS: The fix works!"

#### Manual PDF Test:
1. **Find a delivery** for Mananti Medical Center
2. **Download PDF** from Delivered Invoices page
3. **Verify PDF shows**:
   - [ ] **Detailed items table** (not just weight)
   - [ ] Item names and quantities
   - [ ] **NO "Generated on" timestamps anywhere**

### 2. Test Other Clients (Regression Testing)

#### Test different content display modes:
1. **Find a client** with `contentDisplay: 'summary'`
   - [ ] PDF shows summary with total weight and item count
   - [ ] No "Generated on" timestamps

2. **Find a client** with `contentDisplay: 'weight-only'`
   - [ ] PDF shows only total weight
   - [ ] No "Generated on" timestamps

3. **Find a client** with default settings
   - [ ] PDF shows detailed items (default behavior)
   - [ ] No "Generated on" timestamps

### 3. Timestamp Removal Verification

#### Check all delivery ticket sections:
- [ ] **Delivery Date Section**: No "Generated:" timestamp
- [ ] **Signature Section**: No "Time:" timestamp  
- [ ] **PDF Footer**: No "Generated on [date] at [time]" text
- [ ] **Overall**: No timestamps appear anywhere on the PDF

### 4. Cross-Browser Testing (Optional)
- [ ] Chrome: PDF downloads work correctly
- [ ] Firefox: PDF downloads work correctly
- [ ] Safari: PDF downloads work correctly

## üêõ If Issues Found

### PDF Options Not Working:
1. **Run test script** to check exact configuration
2. **Verify** Mananti's `printConfig.pdfOptions.contentDisplay` is set to `'detailed'`
3. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors during PDF generation
4. **Compare** with working client configurations

### Timestamps Still Appearing:
1. **Check which timestamp** is still showing
2. **Verify** the fix was applied to the correct component
3. **Clear browser cache** and test again
4. **Check** if timestamp is coming from a different code path

### Other Clients Broken:
1. **Test multiple clients** with different configurations
2. **Check console errors** during PDF generation
3. **Verify** the logic change didn't break edge cases
4. **Compare** before/after behavior using the test script
