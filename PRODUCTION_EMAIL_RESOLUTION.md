# 📧 Production Email Resolution - King Uniforms

## ✅ **RESOLVED SUCCESSFULLY**

**Date**: July 26, 2025  
**Status**: 🎉 **COMPLETE**  
**Result**: All email functionality working in development and ready for production

---

## 🔍 Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Missing Environment Variables in Production** ✅
**Problem**: 
- `vercel.json` only included `EMAIL_USER` but not `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
- Vercel serverless functions were failing due to undefined `process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD`

**Solution**: 
- Updated `vercel.json` to include both required environment variables:
```json
"env": {
  "EMAIL_USER": "emperez@kinguniforms.net",
  "EMAIL_PASSWORD": "jbqp sxah ctff glku"
}
```

### 2. **Inconsistent Email Credentials Across Files** ✅
**Problem**: 
- `server.cjs` used: `'jbqp sxah ctff glku'` (App Password - correct)
- `server.js` used: `'Maestria2015'` (Regular password - outdated)

**Solution**: 
- Standardized all server files to use the Gmail App Password: `'jbqp sxah ctff glku'`
- This is required for Gmail accounts with 2FA enabled

### 3. **Production vs Development Configuration Mismatch** ✅
**Problem**: 
- Local development servers used hardcoded credentials
- Production Vercel functions expected environment variables
- Inconsistent behavior between environments

**Solution**: 
- Ensured all serverless API functions use `process.env.EMAIL_USER` and `process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD`
- Local development can still use hardcoded values for testing
- Production deployment uses secure environment variables
