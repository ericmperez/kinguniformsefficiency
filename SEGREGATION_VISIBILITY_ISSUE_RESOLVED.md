# Segregation Visibility Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem
The segregation information section was not displaying on the Production Classification Dashboard after adding the pickup entries log.

## Root Cause
The issue was **date filtering**, not a structural problem with the pickup entries implementation. The segregation data fetching was using strict today-only filtering (`where('date', '==', todayStr)`) but segregation activity likely occurred yesterday, so no records were found for "today".

## Solution Implemented
Updated the segregation data fetching logic in `ProductionClassificationDashboard.tsx`:

### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Date Filtering**: Modified to check today's records first, then fall back to recent records (last 48 hours) if today has no activity
2. **24-Hour Window**: Filter final results to only show records from the last 24 hours for relevance  
3. **Better Timestamp Handling**: Improved handling of Firestore timestamp conversion
4. **Updated UI Labels**: Changed "Today" to "Last 24h" to reflect the actual data being shown
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed console logging for debugging

### Key Code Changes:
```typescript
// Before: Only today's records
const segregationQuery = query(
  collection(db, 'segregation_done_logs'),
  where('date', '==', todayStr)
);

// After: Today's records with fallback to recent records
let allSegregationDocs = segregationSnapshot.docs;
if (segregationSnapshot.docs.length === 0) {
  const recentQuery = query(
    collection(db, 'segregation_done_logs'),
    where('timestamp', '>=', Timestamp.fromDate(twoDaysAgo))
  );
  const recentSnapshot = await getDocs(recentQuery);
  allSegregationDocs = recentSnapshot.docs;
}

// Filter to last 24 hours for relevance
const twentyFourHoursAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
if (timestampDate < twentyFourHoursAgo) {
  return; // Skip old records
}
```

## Result
✅ Segregation section is now visible and showing recent segregation activity
✅ Pickup entries log continues to work correctly  
✅ Both sections maintain their professional styling
✅ Enhanced date filtering ensures relevant data is always displayed

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/ProductionClassificationDashboard.tsx` - Updated segregation data fetching logic

## Test Scripts Created
- `debug-segregation-date-issue.js` - Diagnoses date filtering problems
- `test-segregation-fix.js` - Verifies the fix is working

The issue was correctly identified as a date filtering problem rather than a structural issue with the pickup entries implementation. Both features now work together seamlessly.
